To run: open the whole document using VSC, and access to local host: http://127.0.0.1:5500/
All the daten are saved under data/${name of the saved}/${1-4}.jpeg

This is the beginner version so it has disadvantages: 
1) The data should be saved from 1 to the number of photos
2) The images must be saved as JPEG format
